# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and dlib. The goal is to detect and recognize faces from images or live video feeds with high accuracy.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition from images or video streams.
- Real-time face recognition with a camera feed.
- Easy integration with various input/output devices (e.g., webcams, file uploads).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, dlib, NumPy
- **Model:** Face recognition

## Results
- Provide some sample images or videos showing detected and recognized faces.
- Discuss the performance and accuracy of the system.

## Future Improvements
- Improve recognition accuracy with deeper models.
- Add face tracking capabilities.
- Optimize the system for real-time performance on low-resource devices.
- Integrate with cloud services for large-scale data processing.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests. Any contribution is appreciated!
