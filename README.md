# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and dlib. The goal is to detect and recognize faces from images or live video feeds with high accuracy.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition from images or video streams.
- Support for multiple faces.
- Real-time face recognition with a camera feed.
- Pre-trained model usage for improved accuracy and speed.
- Easy integration with various input/output devices (e.g., webcams, file uploads).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, dlib, NumPy
- **Model:** Face recognition based on ResNet pre-trained models
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-project.git
    cd face-recognition-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download pre-trained models for face recognition:
    ```bash
    # Example link or instruction to download model
    wget http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
    wget http://dlib.net/files/dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat.bz2
    ```

4. Extract the model files:
    ```bash
    bzip2 -d shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
    bzip2 -d dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat.bz2
    ```

## Usage

1. To run face detection on an image:
    ```bash
    python detect_faces.py --image path_to_image.jpg
    ```

2. To start real-time face recognition using a webcam:
    ```bash
    python recognize_faces.py --camera
    ```

3. (Optional) Train your own model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py --data_dir path_to_training_data
    ```

## Dataset
- You can use datasets like [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) or any custom dataset for training.

## Project Structure
- `detect_faces.py`: Script for face detection.
- `recognize_faces.py`: Script for face recognition.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the model.
- `models/`: Contains pre-trained models or model weights.
- `data/`: Directory for input data.
- `outputs/`: Directory for saving output results (e.g., images with detected faces).

## Results
- Provide some sample images or videos showing detected and recognized faces.
- Discuss the performance and accuracy of the system.

## Future Improvements
- Improve recognition accuracy with deeper models.
- Add face tracking capabilities.
- Optimize the system for real-time performance on low-resource devices.
- Integrate with cloud services for large-scale data processing.
